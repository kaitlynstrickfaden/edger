Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Kaitlyn",
           family = "Strickfaden",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: This package allows the user to read in a "reference image", 
    specify a region of interest, and highlight edges within that
    region. It then finds those pixels in a new image(s) and recolors 
    them. This gives the user the ability to find an object of interest 
    in an image and overlay it onto new images.
